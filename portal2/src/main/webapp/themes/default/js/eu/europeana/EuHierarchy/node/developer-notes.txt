Hierarchies notes to developers:


to test non-flat hierarchies a dummy data server can be run (if you have node installed) - the commands:

cd [project-root]/portal2/src/main/webapp/themes/default/js/eu/europeana/EuHierarchy/node
node server-api.js

will start the dummy server on port 3000.

The local url:

http://localhost:3000/index.html

provides a means to test the dummy server.  For example, type a node id (try "1") into the text field and hit the button.

The file "index-api.html" references the actual file used by the portal (EuHierarchy2.js) - index-api.html is for testing data structures that may be unavailable in the real data the portal uses.

The dummy server allows cross-domain requests, so the index-api.html doesn't have to be run in a server - it can be clicked - sending your browser to:

file:///[project-root]/portal2/src/main/webapp/themes/default/js/eu/europeana/EuHierarchy/node/index2.html

However running the file this way stops you from being able to see the xhr traffic in your browser development tools, so the local url:

http://localhost:3000/index-api.html

should be used.

In this way the front end code can be tested with fake data that isn't in a flat hierarchy.
